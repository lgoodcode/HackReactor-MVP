# MVP Project

The project is a simple web application that allows users to create a library of their
favorite games. The user will also be able to set a personal rating, choose the level
of completion (completed, not completed, etc.), and add a personal review of the game.

- The user will be able to select a game and see more details about it. 
- The user will also be able to add a game to their favorites list. 
- The user can also select whether they have completed the game or not.
- The user will be able to rate the game and the rating will be displayed 
on the game details page.
